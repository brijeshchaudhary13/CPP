#### **Q1. Vehicle Number Plate Combinations**

> In a vehicle number plate, we have 4 integer digits. How many unique numbers can we make using these digits?

* **Assumption**: Each digit can be from 0 to 9.
* **If repetition is allowed**:
  Total combinations = $10 \times 10 \times 10 \times 10 = 10^4 = \boxed{10,000}$
* **If repetition is *not* allowed**:
  Total combinations = $10 \times 9 \times 8 \times 7 = \boxed{5,040}$

#### **Q2. Solve Linear Equations**

Solve the following system of equations:

```
2x + y = 1  
x  - 5y = 4
```

**Solution**:
From 2nd equation:
  $x = 4 + 5y$

Substitute into 1st:
  $2(4 + 5y) + y = 1$
  $8 + 10y + y = 1$
  $11y = -7 \Rightarrow y = -7/11$

Then,
  $x = 4 + 5(-7/11) = 4 - 35/11 = (44 - 35)/11 = 9/11$

 **Answer**: $\boxed{x = \frac{9}{11},\ y = -\frac{7}{11}}$

#### **Q3. Probability of Choosing 2 Queens from a Deck**

> What is the probability of selecting 2 Queens from a standard deck of 52 cards?

* Total ways to choose 2 cards from 52 = $\binom{52}{2} = 1326$
* Ways to choose 2 Queens = $\binom{4}{2} = 6$
* Probability = $\frac{6}{1326} = \boxed{\frac{1}{221}} \approx 0.452\%$

#### **Q4. C++ Array Program (Fix the Error)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
// Fix the incorrect header
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

/*
1. Define integer array {1,2,3,4,5}
2. Calculate the size of the array
3. Print each element on a newline
*/

int main() {
    int arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    int n = sizeof(arr) / sizeof(arr[0]);

    cout << "Array size: " << n << endl;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        cout << arr[i] << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

 Fixes:

* `#include <bits/stdc++.h>` (not `<bits/sdtc++>`)
* Used `sizeof(arr)` instead of `arr.size()`, which works only for vectors.

#### **Q5. Insert at Position in Array vs List**
#### **Q5.1. How to Insert, access, delete an Element at 1st and 3rd Position in Array vs Linked List also tell me time complexty


| **Operation**              | **Array**                                                 | **Time** | **Linked List**                                                    | **Time** |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| **Insert at 1st position** | Shift all elements to the right → Insert at `arr[0]`      | O(n)     | Create a new node → Point it to current head → Update head pointer | O(1)     |
| **Insert at 3rd position** | Shift elements from index 2 onward → Insert at `arr[2]`   | O(n)     | Traverse to 2nd node → Insert after it                             | O(n)     |
| **Access 1st element**     | Access `arr[0]`                                           | O(1)     | Access `head`                                                      | O(1)     |
| **Access 3rd element**     | Access `arr[2]`                                           | O(1)     | Traverse two nodes from `head`                                     | O(n)     |
| **Delete 1st element**     | Shift all elements left from index 1 → Remove `arr[0]`    | O(n)     | Update `head` to point to next node                                | O(1)     |
| **Delete 3rd element**     | Shift elements left from index 3 onward → Remove `arr[2]` | O(n)     | Traverse to 2nd node → Change pointer to skip 3rd node             | O(n)     |

---

### 🔍 Summary:

* **Arrays** provide **fast random access** but are **expensive for insert/delete** at arbitrary positions.
* **Linked Lists** allow **efficient insert/delete at the beginning**, but **slow access and insert** at arbitrary positions due to traversal.

#### **Q6. Binary Search vs Linear Search**

**Linear Search (Unsorted or Sorted List)**:

```cpp
int linearSearch(int arr[], int n, int key) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
        if (arr[i] == key) return i;
    return -1;
}
```

**Binary Search (Sorted List only)**:

```cpp
int binarySearch(int arr[], int low, int high, int key) {
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == key) return mid;
        else if (arr[mid] < key) low = mid + 1;
        else high = mid - 1;
    }
    return -1;
}
```

 **Complexity**:

* Linear Search: O(n)
* Binary Search: O(log n)

#### **Q1. Function Overloading — Write Program**

 **Definition**:
Function Overloading allows multiple functions with the same name but different parameter types or counts.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Print {
public:
    void show(int a) {
        cout << "Integer: " << a << endl;
    }

    void show(double b) {
        cout << "Double: " << b << endl;
    }

    void show(string s) {
        cout << "String: " << s << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Print obj;
    obj.show(10);
    obj.show(3.14);
    obj.show("Hello");
    return 0;
}
```

 **Output**:

```
Integer: 10  
Double: 3.14  
String: Hello
```

---

#### **Q2. Method Overriding — Write Program**

 **Definition**:
**Method Overriding** happens in **inheritance**, where a **child class redefines a base class function** using the same signature.
Requires **virtual** keyword for polymorphism.

### Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Animal {
public:
    virtual void sound() {
        cout << "Animal makes sound" << endl;
    }
};

class Dog : public Animal {
public:
    void sound() override {
        cout << "Dog barks" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Animal* a;        // Base class pointer
    Dog d;
    a = &d;
    a->sound();       // Calls Dog's version due to virtual function
    return 0;
}
```

 **Output**:

```
Dog barks
```

---

#### **Q3. Dynamic Allocation — Explain with Example**

 **Explanation**:
Dynamic memory allocation allows memory to be allocated during **runtime** using the `new` keyword in C++.

```cpp
int* p = new int;
```

* `int* p` → Declares a pointer to an integer.
* `new int` → Allocates memory for one `int` on the heap and returns its address.
* `p` now points to that memory.

You can assign value like this:

```cpp
*p = 42;
cout << *p << endl;  // Output: 42
```

 **Important**:
After usage, free memory using:

```cpp
delete p;
```

### Full Example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int* p = new int;  // Dynamic allocation
    *p = 42;           // Assign value
    cout << "Value at p: " << *p << endl;

    delete p;          // Free memory
    return 0;
}
```

 **Output**:

```
Value at p: 42
```

##  **C++ Core Concepts**

### 1. **Describe `static` and `const` variables in C++.**

* **`static`**: A static variable retains its value between function calls. It is initialized only once.
* **`const`**: A `const` variable cannot be modified after initialization. It enforces read-only access.

### 2. **What are storage classes in C++ and their types?**

* Storage classes define scope, lifetime, and visibility of variables.
* Types:

  * `auto`
  * `register`
  * `static`
  * `extern`
  * `mutable` (special case for class members)

### 3. **What is a copy constructor? Why define it manually in C++?**

* A **copy constructor** initializes an object using another object of the same class.
* C++ provides a default one, but:

  * You define it manually to handle **deep copies**, especially when your class manages dynamic memory (pointers).

### 4. **What is the use of pointers in C++?**

* Pointers are used to:

  * Access memory directly
  * Allocate dynamic memory (`new` / `delete`)
  * Enable function parameters to be passed by reference
  * Build complex structures like linked lists and trees

### 5. **What is call by value and call by reference?**

* **Call by Value**: A copy of the argument is passed. Changes don’t affect the original variable.
* **Call by Reference**: The actual variable is passed using references (`&`), so changes affect the original.

### 6. **What is a namespace in C++?**

* A **namespace** groups named entities (like functions, classes) to avoid name conflicts.
* Example:

  ```cpp
  namespace MySpace {
      int val = 10;
  }
  ```

---

##  **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**

### 7. **What are the basic OOP concepts in C++?**

### 8. **Explain method overloading vs overriding.**

### 9. **What is an abstract class in C++?**

* A class with at least one **pure virtual function**.
* Cannot be instantiated, only inherited.

  ```cpp
  class Shape {
      virtual void draw() = 0;
  };
  ```

---

##  **STL and Multithreading**

### 10. **Basics of STL in C++?**

* STL (Standard Template Library) provides:

  * **Containers**: vector, list, map, etc.
  * **Algorithms**: sort, find, etc.
  * **Iterators**: like pointers to navigate containers

### 11. **What is multithreading in C++?**

---

##  **Advanced Concepts**

### 12. **What is memory leak in C++?**

* Memory that is allocated but never deallocated.
* Causes:

  * Missing `delete` after `new`
  * Losing pointer reference to allocated memory

### 13. **How to convert 2 stacks into a heap?**

* **If you mean implementing a heap using two stacks:**

  * This is unconventional; heaps are best implemented with arrays or vectors.
  * Two stacks are more suited for simulating queues or tracking call stacks.
  * Clarify this question if it was metaphorical or a misstatement.

### **HCL - Interview Questions**
Round 1: 50 min

### **Q1.**

```cpp
int a = 5;
int b[a];
```

#### What happens here?

* In **C99 (and later)**: Variable-Length Arrays (VLAs) are allowed — so this is **valid in C**, if `a` is not a constant expression.
* In **C++**: This is **invalid**, because the size of an array must be a **compile-time constant**.

**Correct C++ version:**

```cpp
const int a = 5;
int b[a];  // valid, because a is const
```

---
### **Q2. **We use **`virtual`** to enable **runtime polymorphism**, also called **dynamic binding**.
Without `virtual`, **compile-time (static) binding** happens.

---

###  Case 1: **Using `virtual`**

```cpp
class A {
public:
    virtual void show() {  // virtual
        cout << "A";
    }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    void show() override {
        cout << "B";
    }
};

int main() {
    A *obj = new B();
    obj->show();
}
```

**Output:**

```
B
```

#### **Why?**

* `virtual` makes the function **dynamic**.
* The actual object type at **runtime** is `B`.
* So it calls **B::show()**.

This is **Runtime Polymorphism**.

---

###  Case 2: **Not using `virtual`**

```cpp
class A {
public:
    void show() {   // NOT virtual
        cout << "A";
    }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    void show() {   // overrides but not virtual
        cout << "B";
    }
};

int main() {
    A *obj = new B();
    obj->show();
}
```

**Output:**

```
A
```

#### **Why?**

* Without `virtual`, the function call is bound at **compile time** (static binding).
* Compiler sees pointer type `A*` so it calls **A::show()**, not B.

---

###  Simple Definition to Remember

> **`virtual` tells C++ to choose the function based on the actual object, not the pointer type.**


---
### **Q2.**

```cpp
A a;
a += a;
```

#### Explanation:

* This means you’re using the **operator `+=`** on an object of class `A`.
* So, for this to work, you must **overload** the operator `+=`.

**Example:**

```cpp
class A {
public:
    int x;
    A(int val = 0) : x(val) {}

    A& operator+=(const A& other) {
        x += other.x;
        return *this;
    }
};

int main() {
    A a(5);
    a += a;  // now works, x = 10
}
```

---

### **Q3. Singleton class**

A **Singleton** is a class that allows only **one instance** of itself.

 **Example in C++:**

```cpp
class Singleton {
private:
    static Singleton* instance;
    Singleton() {}  // private constructor

public:
    static Singleton* getInstance() {
        if (!instance)
            instance = new Singleton();
        return instance;
    }
};

// initialize static member
Singleton* Singleton::instance = nullptr;
```

Usage:

```cpp
Singleton* obj = Singleton::getInstance();
```

---

### **Q4.**

> Write array input random 0–9, with **odd numbers first, even numbers next (in-place)**

 **Example in C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    srand(time(0));
    int n = 10;
    vector<int> arr(n);

    // random fill 0–9
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        arr[i] = rand() % 10;

    cout << "Original: ";
    for (int x : arr) cout << x << " ";
    cout << endl;

    // partition: odds first, evens later
    int left = 0, right = n - 1;
    while (left < right) {
        while (left < n && arr[left] % 2 == 1) left++;
        while (right >= 0 && arr[right] % 2 == 0) right--;
        if (left < right) swap(arr[left], arr[right]);
    }

    cout << "Rearranged: ";
    for (int x : arr) cout << x << " ";
    cout << endl;
}
```

✅ **Output example:**

```
Original: 4 7 2 9 3 8 5 0 1 6
Rearranged: 1 7 5 9 3 8 2 0 4 6
```

Round 1: 20 MCQ, 1 Program for 1hr
---

### **1. If A + B means A is the mother of B; A - B means A is the brother of B; A % B means A is the father of B and A x B means A is the sister of B, which of the following shows that P is the maternal uncle of Q?**

**Options:**

* (A) Q - N + M x P
* (B) P + S x N - Q
* (C) P - M + N x Q
* (D) Q - S % P

**Solution:**

We want:
**P is male (brother) of Q’s mother** ⇒ "maternal uncle"

Check Option (C): `P - M + N x Q`
→ `P - M`: P is **brother** of M
→ `M + N`: M is **mother** of N
→ `N x Q`: N is **sister** of Q

So M is Q's mother, and P is her brother ⇒ **P is maternal uncle of Q**

**Correct Answer: (C) P - M + N x Q**

---

### **2. Reena took a loan of Rs. 1200 with simple interest for as many years as the rate of interest. If she paid Rs. 432 as interest at the end of the loan period, what was the rate of interest?**

**Options:**
A. 3, B. 6, C. 18, D. Cannot be determined, E. None of these

**Solution:**

Let rate = time = `x` years
SI = (P × R × T) / 100 = (1200 × x × x) / 100 = 432
→ 12x² = 432
→ x² = 36
→ x = 6

**Correct Answer: 6**

---

### **3. A alone can do a piece of work in 6 days and B alone in 8 days. A and B undertook to do it for Rs. 3200. With the help of C, they completed the work in 3 days. How much is to be paid to C?**

**Options:**
A. Rs. 375, B. Rs. 400, C. Rs. 600, D. Rs. 800

**Solution:**

* A’s 1-day work = 1/6
* B’s 1-day work = 1/8
* Together in 1 day: A + B = (1/6 + 1/8) = 7/24
* In 3 days: 3 × 7/24 = 7/8
* So, C did (1 - 7/8) = 1/8 of work
* C’s share = 1/8 × 3200 = ₹400

**Correct Answer: ₹400**

---

### **4. If a person walks at 14 km/hr instead of 10 km/hr, he would have walked 20 km more. The actual distance travelled by him is:**

**Options:**
A.50 km,  B.56 km,  C.70 km,  D.80 km

**Solution:**

Let time = t hours
Distance at 14 km/h = 14t
Distance at 10 km/h = 10t
Difference = 14t - 10t = 4t = 20
→ t = 5
→ Actual distance = 10 × 5 = **50 km**

**Correct Answer: 50 km**

---

### **5. A train running at the speed of 60 km/hr crosses a pole in 9 seconds. What is the length of the train?**

**Options:**
A.120 m,  B.180 m,  C.324 m,  D.150 m

**Solution:**
* Speed = 60 km/hr = (60 × 1000) / 3600 = 16.67 m/s
* Length = speed × time = 16.67 × 9 ≈ **150 m**

 **Correct Answer: 150 metres**

---

### **6. Three unbiased coins are tossed. What is the probability of getting at most two heads?**

**Options:**
A.3/4  B.1/4  C.3/8  D.7/8
 **Solution:**
Total outcomes = 2³ = 8
Favorable outcomes for **at most 2 heads** = all except 3 heads = 7 outcomes
→ Probability = 7/8

**Correct Answer: D. 7/8**
---
### **7. Given a sentence, rearrange the words in order of increasing length. The first word in the resulting sentence should be capitalized, and all other words should be in lowercase. Ignore punctuation and the original capitalization of words, except that the first word in the final result must start with a capital letter.

*Input:*
A sentence: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"

*Output:*
"The fox the dog over lazy quick brown jumps"

 **Solution:**
 ```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <cctype>

using namespace std;

// Function to convert a string to lowercase
string toLower(const string& str) {
    string result = str;
    for (char& c : result)
        c = tolower(c);
    return result;
}

// Function to capitalize the first character
string capitalizeFirst(const string& str) {
    if (str.empty()) return str;
    string result = toLower(str);
    result[0] = toupper(result[0]);
    return result;
}

int main() {
    string sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog";
    stringstream ss(sentence);
    string word;
    vector<string> words;

    // Split sentence into words
    while (ss >> word) {
        // Remove punctuation
        word.erase(remove_if(word.begin(), word.end(), ::ispunct), word.end());
        words.push_back(toLower(word));
    }

    // Sort by word length
    sort(words.begin(), words.end(), [](const string& a, const string& b) {
        return a.length() < b.length();
    });

    // Capitalize the first word
    if (!words.empty()) {
        words[0] = capitalizeFirst(words[0]);
    }

    // Print result
    for (size_t i = 0; i < words.size(); ++i) {
        cout << words[i];
        if (i != words.size() - 1) cout << " ";
    }

    return 0;
}

```
Output
```
The fox the dog over lazy quick brown jumps
```

### **7.1. Reads a string and prints each word along with its frequency.
```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string str;
    getline(cin, str);  // Read full input line

    unordered_map<string, int> freq;
    string word = "";

    for (char ch : str) {
        if (ch == ' ') {
            if (!word.empty()) {
                freq[word]++;
                word = "";
            }
        } else {
            word += ch;
        }
    }

    // Don't forget the last word
    if (!word.empty()) {
        freq[word]++;
    }

    // Print word frequencies
    for (auto& pair : freq) {
        cout << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```
Input:
```
"apple banana apple orange"
```
Output
```
apple: 2
banana: 1
orange: 1
```
---
### **8. Given a string s, return the first character that does not repeat (i.e., appears exactly once) in the string.
If there is no such character, return -1.

You must return the character as-is (not index), or -1 if no unique character is found.

Function Signature:

char firstUniqueChar(const std::string& s);
Input:

A single string s consisting of lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').
1 <= s.length <= 10^5
Output:

Return the first non-repeating character in the string.
If no such character exists, return -1.
Examples:

Input: "abbacddhh"
Output: 'c'

Input: "abacdhdh"
Output: 'b'

Input: "abbaddhh"
Output: -1
Constraints:

The input string contains only lowercase English letters.
Must return the first non-repeating character in order of appearance.
Return character as char, and return -1 if none found.

 **Solution:**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <string>

char firstUniqueChar(const std::string& s) {
    std::unordered_map<char, int> freq;

    // First pass: Count frequencies
    for (char ch : s) {
        freq[ch]++;
    }

    // Second pass: Find first character with frequency 1

### **9. A faulty watch loses 20 seconds every 3 hours. It was set correctly at 2:00 AM. What is the correct time when the watch shows 6:30 PM the next day?

**A.** 6:28:15 PM
**B.** 6:34:30 PM
**C.** 6:36:00 PM
**D.** 6:32:45 PM

**Correct Answer: B. 6:34:30 PM**

* Watch loses 20 seconds every 3 hours.
* Total time from 2:00 AM to 6:30 PM next day = 40.5 hours.
* Number of 3-hour intervals in 40.5 hours = 40.5 ÷ 3 = 13.5.
* Total loss = 13.5 × 20 seconds = 270 seconds = 4 minutes 30 seconds.
* When watch shows 6:30 PM, actual time = 6:30 PM + 4 min 30 sec = **6:34:30 PM**.

**Answer: 6:34:30 PM**

### Q1. What is OOP? Explain all pillars with examples.

---

### Q2. Explain function overriding and write a program and explain code.
---

### Q3. Map, Array vs Map, Vector, Vector vs Array

* **Map:** Associative container storing key-value pairs (sorted by key).
* **Array:** Fixed-size collection of elements (contiguous memory).
* **Vector:** Dynamic array (resizable, provides many utility functions).

| Feature  | Array              | Vector               | Map                         |
| -------- | ------------------ | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Size     | Fixed              | Dynamic              | Dynamic                     |
| Memory   | Contiguous         | Contiguous           | Node-based (not contiguous) |
| Access   | Fast (index-based) | Fast (index-based)   | Key-based                   |
| Use case | When size is known | When size can change | Key-value storage           |

### Q5. What does this code do?

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    []{}();
    return 0;
}
```

* Defines and immediately calls an **empty [lambda](/LambdaExpressions.md) function**. The program does nothing visible and returns 0.

---

### Q6. Is this code valid? Why or why not?

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a;
    int &&b = a;
    return 0;
}
```
* Status :Compilation error
* **Invalid.**
* You cannot bind an **rvalue reference** (`int&&`) to an **lvalue** (`a`).
* Correct usage: `int&& b = 5;` or use `std::move(a)` to cast `a` to an rvalue.
---
### **Lvalue**

* An **Lvalue** refers to an **object that has a name and a memory address**.
* You can take the address of an lvalue.
* Can appear on the **left-hand side** of an assignment.

**Example:**

```cpp
int x = 10;   // x is an lvalue
x = 20;       // OK: lvalue can be assigned
```

### **Lvalue Reference** (`&`) 
* An lvalue reference in C++ is a reference (alias) to an lvalue — that is, a variable or object that has a persistent memory address.
* It is declared using a single ampersand &.

**Example:**
```cpp
int x = 10;
int& ref = x;   // ref is an lvalue reference to x
```
---

### **Rvalue**

* An **Rvalue** is a **temporary object** or literal with **no persistent memory address**.
* Can only appear on the **right-hand side** of an assignment.
* **Cannot take its address**.

**Example:**

```cpp
int y = x + 5;   // (x + 5) is an rvalue
```

---

### **Rvalue Reference** (`&&`)

* Introduced in C++11.
* Allows binding to **rvalues (temporaries)**.
* Enables **move semantics** and optimization by avoiding deep copies.

**Syntax:**

```cpp
void process(int&& r) {
    std::cout << "Rvalue reference: " << r << std::endl;
}
```

---

###  **Rvalue Reference vs Lvalue Reference:**

| Feature  | Lvalue Reference (`&`)   | Rvalue Reference (`&&`)      |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Binds to | Named objects (lvalues)  | Temporary objects (rvalues)  |
| Use case | Normal parameter passing | Move semantics, optimization |
| Example  | `int& a = x;`            | `int&& b = 5;`               |

---

### **Code Example**: Lvalue vs Rvalue Reference

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <utility>

void foo(int& x) {
    std::cout << "Lvalue reference called: " << x << "\n";
}

void foo(int&& x) {
    std::cout << "Rvalue reference called: " << x << "\n";
}

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    foo(a);        // Calls lvalue version
    foo(20);       // Calls rvalue version
    foo(std::move(a)); // Forces rvalue, calls rvalue version
}
```

**Output:**

```
Lvalue reference called: 10
Rvalue reference called: 20
Rvalue reference called: 10
```

---

### Q7. Print the pattern:

```
      * * * * 
    * * * * 
  * * * * 
* * * * 
```

**Corrected (aligned) version:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for(int i = 4; i >= 1; i--) {
        for(int j = 1; j < i; j++) cout << "  ";
        for(int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) cout << "* ";
        cout << "\n";
    }
    /* OR
    for(int i = 1; i <= 4; i++) {
        for(int j = i; j < 4; j++) cout << "  ";
        for(int k = 1; k <= 4; k++) cout << "* ";
        cout << "\n";
    }*/

    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
      * * * * 
    * * * * 
  * * * * 
* * * * 
```

### Q8. pointer vs refrence?

| Feature            | Pointer                                                               | Reference                                                             |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**     | A variable that holds the address of another variable.                | An alias for another variable.                                        |
| **Syntax**         | `int* p;`                                                             | `int& r = x;`                                                         |
| **Initialization** | Can be initialized to `nullptr` or any address; can be uninitialized. | Must be initialized when declared; cannot be null.                    |
| **Reassignment**   | Can point to different variables during its lifetime.                 | Cannot be reseated; always refers to the original variable.           |
| **Dereferencing**  | Requires `*` operator to access value.                                | Acts like the variable itself; no extra syntax needed.                |
| **Memory**         | Takes its own memory (stores an address).                             | No extra memory; just another name for the variable.                  |
| **Nullability**    | Can be null (i.e., point to nothing).                                 | Cannot be null.                                                       |
| **Use cases**      | Dynamic data structures, optional referencing, pointer arithmetic.    | Pass-by-reference in functions, operator overloading, safer aliasing. |

---

### Example:

```cpp
int x = 10;

// Pointer
int* p = &x;
*p = 20;   // Changes x to 20

// Reference
int& r = x;
r = 30;    // Changes x to 30

// Reassign pointer
int y = 40;
p = &y;    // Now p points to y

// Reference cannot be reassigned
// r = y;  // This assigns value of y to x, but r still refers to x
```
---
### Q9. Is this code valid? Why or why not?
```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int&& r1 = 10;     // OK: rvalue reference binds to a literal (rvalue)
    std::cout << r1 << "\n";  // prints 10

    // int a = 5;
    // int&& r2 = a;   // ERROR: cannot bind rvalue reference to lvalue

    return 0;
}
```
Output
```
10
```
### Explanation:

* `int&& r1 = 10;` is **valid** because `10` is an rvalue (a temporary literal), and rvalue references can bind to rvalues.
* Uncommenting the lines:

  ```cpp
  int a = 5;
  int&& r2 = a;   // ERROR
  ```

  would produce an error because `a` is an lvalue, and an rvalue reference cannot bind directly to an lvalue.

---

### Additional notes:

* If you want to bind an rvalue reference to an lvalue, you have to explicitly cast it to an rvalue using `std::move` or `std::forward`:

```cpp
int a = 5;
int&& r2 = std::move(a);  // OK: std::move converts lvalue to rvalue
```
---


## **Q1: What is the issue in the following code?**

```cpp
void createMemory() {
    int* p = new int[100];    
}
 
int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        createMemory();
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### **Answer:**

This code has a **memory leak**.
Inside `createMemory()`, memory is allocated using `new int[100]`, but it is **never freed** using `delete[]`.
When the function ends, the pointer `p` goes out of scope, and the allocated memory becomes unreachable, causing memory leakage.

### **Corrected Code:**

```cpp
void createMemory() {
    int* p = new int[100];
    delete[] p; // memory freed properly
}
```

### **Best Practice (Avoid Raw Pointers):**

```cpp
#include <vector>
void createMemory() {
    std::vector<int> p(100); // no delete needed, memory auto-managed
}
```

---

## **Q2: What will happen if we accidentally increment the wrong loop variable?**

### **Corrected Code:**

```cpp
int n = 5;
for(int i = n; i > 0; i--) {
    for(int j = 0; j < i; j++) {   
        cout << " ";
    }
    for(int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        cout << "*" << " ";
    }
    cout << endl;
}
```

### **Correct Output (for n = 5):**

```
     * * * * *
    * * * * *
   * * * * *
  * * * * *
 * * * * *
```

### 📌 Tips for Use

* Use **`vector`** when you need fast random access and dynamic resizing.
* Use **`list`/`forward_list`** when frequent insertions/deletions happen at arbitrary positions.
* Use **`set`/`map`** for sorted elements with fast lookup.
* Use **`unordered_set`/`unordered_map`** for faster average lookups when ordering is not needed.
* Use **`deque`** if you need to insert/remove from both front and back.
* Use **`queue`** or **`stack`** when order of processing (FIFO/LIFO) is needed.

### **Q13. Implementations of a List in C++**

### **Q14. **Nearest Floor Request in Given Direction**

### 📝 Problem Description:

A lift (elevator) is currently at a floor and moving in a specific direction (`"Up"` or `"Down"`). It has received exactly 3 floor requests from users waiting on different floors.

Write a function to determine **which one of the requested floors is nearest to the current floor in the same direction as the lift is moving**.
Return that floor number.

If no floor request is valid in the given direction, return `-1`.

---

### 🔧 Function Signature:

```cpp
int nearestFloor(int currLocation, string curDir, vector<int>& demandArr);
```

---

### 🧪 Input:

* `currLocation` (1 ≤ currLocation ≤ 100): current floor of the lift
* `curDir`: a string `"Up"` or `"Down"` representing the direction
* `demandArr`: a list of 3 integers (1 ≤ demandArr\[i] ≤ 100) representing requested floors

---

### 📤 Output:

* Return the floor that is closest to `currLocation` in the specified `curDir` direction.
* If no valid floor in the given direction exists, return `-1`.

---

### ✅ Example 1:

```cpp
Input: 
currLocation = 5  
curDir = "Down"  
demandArr = [2, 4, 6]

Output: 
4

Explanation:
Valid "Down" requests (i.e. less than 5): 2, 4  
Among these, 4 is the closest to 5.
```

---

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <climits>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int demandArr[3];
    int currLocation;
    string curDir;

    cin >> currLocation;
    cin >> curDir;

    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
        cin >> demandArr[i];
    }

    int nearest = -1;
    int minDiff = INT_MAX;

    if (curDir == "Up") {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if (demandArr[i] > currLocation) {
                int diff = demandArr[i] - currLocation;
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    minDiff = diff;
                    nearest = demandArr[i];
                }
            }
        }
    } else if (curDir == "Down") {
        for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
            if (demandArr[i] < currLocation) {
                int diff = currLocation - demandArr[i];
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    minDiff = diff;
                    nearest = demandArr[i];
                }
            }
        }
    } else {
        cout << "Invalid direction\n";
        return 1;
    }

    if (nearest != -1) {
        cout << "Stop at floor: " << nearest << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "No valid floor in the given direction.\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

### iQuest - Interview Questions**
Round 1: 1hr

Q1. [lambda](/LambdaExpressions.md) Function: In C++, the syntax `[]() {}` is the basic structure of a **lambda function**. Let's break it down:

## Syntax:

```cpp
[capture](parameter_list) -> return_type { function_body }
```

Your minimal example:

```cpp
[]() {}
```

Means:

* `[]` → Capture list (what variables you want to access from outside)
* `()` → Parameters (like a normal function)
* `{}` → Function body (what the lambda does)

---

## Detailed Breakdown

| Part                          | Description                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[]`                          | **Capture list** – lets the lambda access variables from the surrounding scope. |
| `()`                          | **Parameter list** – like arguments to a function.                              |
| `{}`                          | **Function body** – code to run when lambda is called.                          |
| `-> return_type` *(optional)* | Specifies return type (can often be omitted if deducible).                      |


##  Example 1: Basic Lambda

```cpp
auto greet = []() {
    cout << "Hello from lambda!" << endl;
};
greet();
```

**Output:**

```
Hello from lambda!
```

##  Example 2: With Parameters

```cpp
auto add = [](int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
};
cout << add(3, 4);  // Output: 7
```
##  Example 3: With Capture List

```cpp
int x = 10;
auto show = [x]() {
    cout << "Captured x = " << x << endl;
};
show();
```
##  Example 4
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> v = {5, 2, 8, 1, 3};

    // Lambda to sort in ascending order
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int a, int b) {
        return a < b;
    });

    // Lambda to print elements
    auto print = [](int x) {
        cout << x << " ";
    };

    for_each(v.begin(), v.end(), print);
    return 0;
}
```

**Output:**

```
1 2 3 5 8
```

## Q2. Check Palindrome String (Iterative + Recursive)

### Iterative Method

```cpp
bool isPalindromeIter(string s) {
    int start = 0, end = s.length() - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        if (s[start] != s[end]) return false;
        start++;
        end--;
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Recursive Method

```cpp
bool isPalindromeRec(string s, int start, int end) {
    if (start >= end)
        return true;
    if (s[start] != s[end])
        return false;
    return isPalindromeRec(s, start + 1, end - 1);
}
```

### Usage

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    string str;
    cout << "Enter string: ";
    cin >> str;

    cout << "Iterative: " << (isPalindromeIter(str) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    cout << "Recursive: " << (isPalindromeRec(str, 0, str.size() - 1) ? "Yes" : "No") << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## Q3. Pass by Value vs Pass by Reference

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Pass by Value
void incrementByValue(int x) {
    x++; // Only modifies local copy
}

// Pass by Reference using &
void incrementByRef1(int &x) {
    x++; // Modifies original variable
}

// Pass by Reference using *
void incrementByRef2(int *x) {
    (*x)++; // Modifies original variable via pointer
}

int main() {
    int a = 5;

    incrementByValue(a);
    cout << "After pass by value: " << a << endl; // Outputs 5

    incrementByRef1(a);
    cout << "After pass by reference (&): " << a << endl; // Outputs 6

    incrementByRef2(&a);
    cout << "After pass by reference (*): " << a << endl; // Outputs 7

    return 0;
}

```

**Output:**

```
After pass by value: 5
After pass by reference (&): 6
After pass by reference (*): 7
```

---

## Q4. Count Binary Substrings Starting and Ending with 1

        if (str[i] == '1') {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (str[j] == '1') {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    cout << count;
    return 0;
}
```

### **Q1: `char *str;` vs `char str[];` in C++**

**Answer:**

| Aspect            | `char *str;`                       | `char str[];`                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Type              | Pointer to char                    | Array of chars                |
| Memory Allocation | Can point to dynamic/static memory | Size is fixed at compile time |
| Resizable?  | ✅ Yes (if dynamically allocated)     | ❌ No (cannot resize after declaration) |
| Modifiable        | Pointer can be reassigned          | Array cannot be reassigned    |
| Example           | `char *str = "Hello";`             | `char str[] = "Hello";`       |


```cpp
char *str1 = "Hello";       // Pointer to a string literal (read-only)
char str2[] = "Hello";      // Array initialized with string (modifiable)
char str[10] = "Hello";
// str = new char[20];  // ❌ Error: cannot reassign an array
```
```cpp
    char* str = new char[10];

| Default Access   | Private                     | Public                      |
| Inheritance      | Default private inheritance | Default public inheritance  |
| Usage            | Typically for OOP           | Typically for data grouping |
| Function Members | Allowed                     | Allowed                     |

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Student {
    int id;
    string name;

public:
    friend istream& operator>>(istream& in, Student& s) {
        in >> s.id >> s.name;  // input from user
        return in;
    }

    friend ostream& operator<<(ostream& out, const Student& s) {
        out << "ID: " << s.id << ", Name: " << s.name;  // output to console
        return out;
    }
};

int main() {
    Student s;
    cin >> s;     // calls overloaded >>
    cout << s;    // calls overloaded <<
    return 0;
}

### **Q6: Do you know Linux?**

**Answer:**
Yes, Linux is a widely used open-source operating system. In development, it's commonly used for:

* Command-line operations
* Shell scripting
* System-level programming
* Managing servers and deployment
* Tools like `gcc`, `g++`, `gdb`, `make`, etc.

Example Linux commands:

```bash
ls       # list files
cd       # change directory
g++ app.cpp -o app  # compile C++ code
./app    # run the program
```

 ### **BMW C++ Interview** 

---

### **1. What is Name Mangling in C++?**

**Q:** What is **name mangling**, and why is it used?

**A:**
Name mangling is the process by which the C++ compiler **modifies function names** (especially overloaded or templated ones) into unique names before compilation.
This allows the linker to differentiate between functions with the same name but different signatures.

 Example:

```cpp
void foo(int);     // Might become _Z3fooi
void foo(float);   // Might become _Z3foof
```

> You can prevent mangling using `extern "C"` for C linkage.

---

### **2. Size of a Class in C++**

**Q:** What determines the **size of a class**?

**A:**
Size of a class depends on:

* Data members (int, char, etc.)
* **Padding** and alignment
* Presence of **virtual functions** (adds vptr)
* Inheritance

**Example:**

```cpp
class A {
    int x;   // 4 bytes
    char y;  // 1 byte + 3 bytes padding
};
```

 Size = 8 bytes (due to padding)

---

### **3. `size()` vs `capacity()` in `std::vector`**

| `vector.size()`                           | `vector.capacity()`                                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Number of elements actually in the vector | Number of elements that can be held before resizing |
| Always ≤ capacity                         | Can be greater than size                            |

```cpp
vector<int> v;
v.push_back(1);
v.push_back(2);

cout << v.size();     // 2
cout << v.capacity(); // maybe 4 or 8 depending on growth
```

---

### **4. What is a Template Class in C++?**

A template class allows you to create a **generic class** that works with any data type.

```cpp
template <typename T>
class Box {
    T value;
public:
    void set(T v) { value = v; }
    T get() { return value; }
};
```

Use:

```cpp
Box<int> intBox;
Box<string> strBox;
```

---

### **5. Constructor and Vtables**

* A class with at least one **virtual function** will have a **vtable**.
* Each object will get a hidden **vptr** pointing to the vtable.
* The **constructor** sets up the `vptr`.

> **Vtable** = Table of function pointers to virtual functions
> **Vptr** = Pointer inside object that points to the class’s vtable

---

### **6. If a class has a virtual function, what is its size?**
Even with **no members**, the class will have a **vptr** (usually 4 or 8 bytes depending on platform).

```cpp
class A {
    virtual void fun() {}
};

int main() {
    cout << sizeof(A); // Output: 8 (on 64-bit), 4 (on 32-bit)
}
```

> Size increases if data members or multiple/virtual inheritance is used.

---

---

### 1. What is your role and responsibility?

---

### 2. What is a Virtual Constructor?
* In C++, constructors cannot be declared `virtual`. But we can use **virtual clone() methods** or factory patterns to simulate behavior similar to virtual constructors.
* It's used when we want to create an object of derived class using a base class pointer.

**Example using `clone()`:**

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual Base* clone() {
        return new Base(*this);
    }
    virtual void show() {
        std::cout << "Base class\n";
    }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    Derived* clone() override {
        return new Derived(*this);
    }
    void show() override {
        std::cout << "Derived class\n";
    }
};
```

---

### 3. What is Multithreading?

---

### 4. Write a Multithreading Example in C++

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

void function1() {
    cout << "Function 1 running\n";
}

void function2() {
    cout << "Function 2 running\n";
}

int main() {
    thread t1(function1);
    thread t2(function2);

    t1.join(); // Wait for t1 to finish
    t2.join(); // Wait for t2 to finish

    cout << "Main thread done\n";
    return 0;
}
```

---

### 5. What is `join()` in threads? What happens if we don’t use `join()`?
* `join()` is used to make the main thread **wait for the child thread to finish execution**.
* If we don't call `join()` and the main thread ends before the child thread, it can cause:

* Program to terminate before child thread finishes.
* Undefined behavior or crash, depending on compiler/system.

            cout << "A Destructor"<<endl;
            
        }
    };
    
class B : public A{ 
    public:
    B(){
    cout << "B constructor"<<endl;
    
    }

    cout << "B Destructor"<<endl;
        
    } 
};

	// your code goes here
	A *p = new B();
	delete p;
	return 0;

}

```
Output
```
A constructor
B constructor
A Destructor
```

### 8. What make you changes that `B Destructor` will call ?

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    A() { cout << "A constructor" << endl; }
    virtual ~A() { cout << "A Destructor" << endl; } // use vitaul destructor
};

class B : public A {
public:
    B() { cout << "B constructor" << endl; }
    ~B() { cout << "B Destructor" << endl; }
};

int main() {
    A *p = new B();  // dynamic allocation
    delete p;        // deleting via base class pointer
    return 0;
}
```

### Key Concept:

* `A *p = new B();` means we are creating an object of class `B` but pointing to it using a base class (`A`) pointer.
* When we call `delete p;`, **only the base class destructor (`~A`) will be called**, unless the base class destructor is declared `virtual`.

### Output Explanation:

1. During `new B();`

   * First, `A`'s constructor runs → prints `A constructor`
   * Then, `B`'s constructor runs → prints `B constructor`

2. During `delete p;`

   * Only `A`'s destructor runs → prints `A Destructor`
   * `B`'s destructor **does not run** because `~A()` is **not virtual**

### **Incorrect behavior** (memory/resource leak) due to missing `virtual` destructor.

### Final Output:

```
A constructor
B constructor
A Destructor
```

### Correct Fix:

To ensure proper destruction, declare the base class destructor as `virtual`:

```cpp
virtual ~A() {
    cout << "A Destructor" << endl;
}
```

Then output would be:

```
A constructor
B constructor
B Destructor
A Destructor
```

### **Q1. Roles and Responsibilities and do u have testing**

### **Q2. WAP in C++ to Reverse a Line Word by Word**
* Step 1: Input String
  	string str;
	getline(cin, str);
* Step 2: Reverse whole string
  	Using 2 pointer approach
	Or revrse function
* Step 3: reverse word by word

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	string str;
	getline(cin, str);
	//cin>>str; //do not use
    string ans = "";
    int n = str.size();

    reverse(str.begin(), str.end()); // fix spelling: revrse -> reverse

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        string word = "";
        // collect characters of a word
        while (i < n && str[i] != ' ') {
            word += str[i];
            i++;
        }
        reverse(word.begin(), word.end()); // reverse individual word
        if (word.length() > 0) {
            ans += word + " ";
        }
    }
    cout << ans << endl;

    return 0;
}

```

---

### **Q3. Dangling Pointer with Example**

A **dangling pointer** is a pointer that points to a memory location that has been **freed/deallocated**.

#### **Example:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int* createPointer() {
    int x = 10;
    return &x; // returns address of local variable
}

int main() {
    int* ptr = createPointer(); // dangling pointer
    cout << *ptr << endl;       // undefined behavior
    return 0;
}
```

> The variable `x` goes out of scope after `createPointer()` finishes, so `ptr` points to an invalid location.

---

### **Q4. Shallow Copy vs Deep Copy**

#### **Shallow Copy:**

* Copies object **without duplicating referenced memory**.
* Changes to the original affect the copy.

#### **Deep Copy:**

* Copies **all fields** and duplicates any **dynamically allocated memory**.

#### **Example in C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;

class Sample {
public:
    char* name;

    // Constructor
    Sample(const char* n) {
        name = new char[strlen(n) + 1];
        strcpy(name, n);
    }

    // Shallow copy constructor
    Sample(const Sample& s) {
        name = s.name;
    }

    // Deep copy constructor
    Sample deepCopy() {
        return Sample(name); // creates new memory
    }

    void show() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << endl;
    }

    ~Sample() {
        delete[] name;
    }
};

int main() {
    Sample s1("Alice");
    Sample s2 = s1;        // Shallow copy (dangerous)
    Sample s3 = s1.deepCopy(); // Deep copy (safe)

    s1.show();
    s2.show();
    s3.show();

    return 0;
}
```

### **Q5.** Memory Leak with Example & How to Prevent It**
A **memory leak** happens when a program **allocates memory on the heap** but **fails to release (deallocate) it** after it's no longer needed. This causes a **gradual increase in memory usage**, leading to performance issues or crashes.

---

### **Example of a Memory Leak in C++**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void memoryLeakExample() {
    int* ptr = new int(10);  // Dynamically allocate memory
    cout << *ptr << endl;
    // Forgot to delete the allocated memory -> memory leak
}

int main() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        memoryLeakExample(); // Each call leaks memory
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Q6.** How to Prevent Memory Leaks

1. **Always deallocate memory** using `delete` or `delete[]` after `new` or `new[]`.

   ```cpp
   int* ptr = new int(20);
   // Use the pointer
   delete ptr; // Free memory
   ```

2. **Use smart pointers (C++11 and above)**:

   * `std::unique_ptr`
   * `std::shared_ptr`
   * Automatically manage memory and prevent leaks.

   ```cpp
   #include <memory>
   std::unique_ptr<int> ptr = std::make_unique<int>(10);
   // Automatically deleted when ptr goes out of scope
   ```

3. **Avoid raw pointers** when possible; use containers like `std::vector`, `std::string`, etc.

4. **Use tools to detect memory leaks:**

   * Valgrind (Linux)
   * Visual Studio Diagnostic Tools (Windows)
   * AddressSanitizer

### ** Siemens.com - Technical Round Interview**
Round 1: 30 min

## 1. **What is C++ (CPP)?**

**C++** is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by **Bjarne Stroustrup** as an extension of the C language.
It supports both **procedural** and **object-oriented** programming (multi-paradigm), offering features like:

* Classes & Objects
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Encapsulation
* Abstraction
* Templates
* Exception handling
* STL (Standard Template Library)

---

## 2. **Difference between Class and Object**

| Feature    | Class                               | Object                             |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Definition | A blueprint or template for objects | An instance of a class             |
| Memory     | No memory is allocated              | Memory is allocated at runtime     |
| Example    | `class Car { };`                    | `Car myCar;`                       |
| Purpose    | Defines behavior and properties     | Implements behavior and holds data |

---

## 3. **Explain OOPs Pillars One by One**

1. **Encapsulation**

   * Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class).
   * Protects data using access specifiers (`private`, `public`, etc.).

2. **Abstraction**

   * Hiding internal details and showing only essential features.
   * Achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

3. **Inheritance**

   * One class (child) can inherit properties and behavior from another class (parent).
   * Promotes code reuse.

4. **Polymorphism**

   * Same function or operator behaves differently in different contexts.
   * Types: Compile-time (Function Overloading) and Runtime (Virtual Functions).

---

## 4. **C++ Program: Insert an Element into a Sorted Array**

** Problem:**
Given a sorted array, insert an element and maintain the sorted order.

** Input:**

```cpp
int arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 7};
int n = 6;
```

** Output:**

```
1, 3, 5, 6, 7
```

### C++ Code (In-place Insertion):

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[100] = {1, 3, 5, 7}; // allocate extra space
    int n = 4;                   // current number of elements
    int element = 6;

    // Find the position to insert
    int i = n - 1;
    while (i >= 0 && arr[i] > element) {
        arr[i + 1] = arr[i]; // shift elements right
        i--;
    }

    // Insert the new element
    arr[i + 1] = element;
    n++; // increment size after insertion

    // Print the updated array
    cout << "Updated array: ";
    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        cout << arr[j];
        if (j < n - 1) cout << ", ";
    }
    cout << endl;

    return 0;
}
```
---

### Output:

```
Updated array: 1, 3, 5, 6, 7
```

### **Q1. What is OOPs? Explain.**
---

### **Q3. Pattern:**

```
1
1 2
1 2 3
```

**Code in C++:**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 3; ++i) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; ++j) {
            cout << j << " ";
        }
        cout << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Q4. What is `shared_ptr`?**

`shared_ptr` is a **smart pointer** in C++ that manages shared ownership of a dynamically allocated object.

* Multiple `shared_ptr`s can point to the same object.
* When the last `shared_ptr` is destroyed or reset, the object is deleted.

**Example:**

```cpp
#include <memory>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    shared_ptr<int> p1 = make_shared<int>(10);
    shared_ptr<int> p2 = p1; // shared ownership

    cout << *p1 << " " << *p2 << endl; // 10 10
    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Q5. Move Constructor, Default Constructor, Default Destructor**

* **Default Constructor**: A constructor with no arguments.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    A() {}  // default constructor
};
```

* **Move Constructor**: Transfers resources from one object to another without copying.

```cpp
class A {
    int* data;
public:
    A(A&& other) {
        data = other.data;
        other.data = nullptr;
    }
};
```

* **Default Destructor**: Automatically deletes/cleans up when object goes out of scope.

```cpp
class A {
public:
    ~A() {}  // default destructor
};
```

---

### **Q6. STL: Array vs Vector vs List**

| Feature   | `array` (std::array) | `vector`             | `list` (std::list)      |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Size      | Fixed                | Dynamic              | Dynamic                 |
| Memory    | Contiguous           | Contiguous           | Non-contiguous (nodes)  |
| Insertion | Costly at middle     | Costly at middle     | Fast at any position    |
| Access    | Fast (random access) | Fast (random access) | Slow (no random access) |
| Use Case  | Known size, speed    | Dynamic arrays       | Frequent insert/delete  |

---

### **Q7. Pass by Reference vs Pass by Value**

* **Pass by Value**: A copy is passed. Changes do **not** reflect outside.

```cpp
void func(int x) { x = 10; }
```

* **Pass by Reference**: Reference is passed. Changes reflect outside.

```cpp
void func(int &x) { x = 10; }
```

---

### **Q7 (code): Pointer behavior**

```cpp
  
int* p1;
int m = 100;

p1 = &m;
*p1++;  // increment pointer, not value. Equivalent to p1 = p1 + 1
++m;    // m = 101
printf("%d\n", *p1); // Undefined behavior
printf("%d\n", m);   // 101
```
Output
```
-122846152
101

```
But 
```cpp
int m = 100;
int* p1;
p1 = &m;
(*p1)++;  // increment pointer, not value. Equivalent to p1 = p1 + 1
++m;    // m = 101
printf("%d\n", *p1); //102
printf("%d\n", m);   // 102
```
Output
```
102
102

```


---

### **Q8: Call dosomething function i main() **

#### Case 1:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void dosomething(int *p) {
    cout << "Inside function: " << *p << endl;  // prints the value pointed by p
}

int main() {
    int P = 10;
    int *ptr = &P;       // create pointer to P
    dosomething(ptr);    // pass pointer to function
    return 0;
}

```
Output
```
Inside function: 10
```
And

```cpp
void dosomething(int &p) {
    cout << "Inside function: " << p << endl;  // no dereferencing needed
}

int main() {
    int P = 10;
    dosomething(P);  // pass variable by reference
}

```
Output
```
Inside function: 10
```
---
### **Q9: Static

In C++, the `static` keyword has **different meanings depending on the context** (variables, functions, class members). Here's a clear breakdown:

---

##  1. **Static Variables (Inside a Function)**

```cpp
void demo() {
    static int count = 0;
    count++;
    std::cout << count << std::endl;
}
```

* **Lifetime:** Exists for the entire program (not destroyed when the function ends).
* **Scope:** Local to the function.
* **Use case:** To retain the value between function calls.

**Output:**

```cpp
demo(); // 1
demo(); // 2
demo(); // 3
```

---

##  2. **Static Variables (Global/Namespace Scope)**

```cpp
static int globalVar = 5;
```

* **Limits visibility to the current translation unit (.cpp file).**
* Useful in large projects to avoid name collisions.

---

##  3. **Static Member Variables in Class**

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    static int count;
};
int MyClass::count = 0;  // Must be defined outside the class

MyClass::count++;  // Access without object
```

* Shared among all objects (only **one copy** exists).
* Can be accessed using the class name (`MyClass::count`).
* Must be **defined outside** the class.

---

##  4. **Static Member Functions in Class**

```cpp
class MyClass {
public:
    static void show() {
        std::cout << "Static function\n";
    }
};
```

* Can be called without an object.
* Cannot access non-static members (no `this` pointer).

---

##  5. **Static Inside a Class (Private Helper)**

```cpp
class Helper {
private:
    static int secret;  // Hidden from outside
};
```

* Encapsulation: Hide implementation details.

---

## Summary Table:

| Context          | Meaning of `static`                             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Inside function  | Retains value across function calls             |
| Global/namespace | Limits scope to file                            |
| Class variable   | Shared across all instances                     |
| Class function   | Can be called without object; no `this` pointer |

### **Q10: Solid Principal

### SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Programming

The **SOLID** principles are five key design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable. These are especially important in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** like C++, Java, C#, etc.

---

### What does SOLID stand for?

| Principle                                     | Description                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** | A class should have **only one reason to change**. It should do **one job only**.                                                          |
| **O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**           | A class should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**. You can extend behavior without changing existing code.          |
| **L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**   | Subclasses should be able to **replace** their parent classes without breaking the functionality.                                          |
| **I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)** | Don’t force a class to implement **interfaces it doesn’t use**. Break large interfaces into smaller ones.                                  |
| **D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**  | Depend on **abstractions, not concretions**. High-level modules shouldn’t depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions. |

---

### Simple Example: (in C++)

---

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**

**Each class should have one and only one responsibility.**

```cpp
class FileReader {
public:
    void readFile(const std::string& filename) {
        // logic to read file
    }
};

class FileWriter {
public:
    void writeFile(const std::string& filename) {
        // logic to write file
    }
};
```

*Each class has a single reason to change — reading or writing.*

---

### 2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**

**Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.**

```cpp
class Shape {
public:
    virtual double area() = 0;
};

class Circle : public Shape {
public:
    double radius;
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}
    double area() override {
        return 3.14 * radius * radius;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
public:
    double width, height;
    Rectangle(double w, double h) : width(w), height(h) {}
    double area() override {
        return width * height;
    }
};
```

*You can add new shapes without modifying existing code.*

---

### 3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

**Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.**

```cpp
class Bird {
public:
    virtual void fly() {
        std::cout << "Flying\n";
    }
};

class Sparrow : public Bird {};

void letBirdFly(Bird* bird) {
    bird->fly();
}
```

*Sparrow can be used in place of Bird without breaking code.*

---

### 4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**

**Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they don’t use.**

```cpp
class IPrinter {
public:
    virtual void print() = 0;
};

class IScanner {
public:
    virtual void scan() = 0;
};

class AllInOnePrinter : public IPrinter, public IScanner {
public:
    void print() override {
        std::cout << "Printing\n";
    }
    void scan() override {
        std::cout << "Scanning\n";
    }
};
```

*Separate interfaces keep implementation clean and focused.*

---

### 5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**

**Depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.**

```cpp
class IMessage {
public:
    virtual void send(const std::string& msg) = 0;
};

class Email : public IMessage {
public:
    void send(const std::string& msg) override {
        std::cout << "Sending Email: " << msg << "\n";
    }
};

class Notification {
    IMessage* message;
public:
    Notification(IMessage* msg) : message(msg) {}
    void notify(const std::string& text) {
        message->send(text);
    }
};
```

*Notification depends on abstraction (IMessage), not on a specific Email class.*

### **Q2: Create all types of constructors + destructor. Why use them?**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class B {
    int x;
public:
    // Default constructor
    B() {
        x = 0;
        cout << "Default Constructor" << endl;
    }

    // Parameterized constructor
    B(int val) {
        x = val;
        cout << "Parameterized Constructor" << endl;
    }

    // Copy constructor
    B(const B &obj) {
        x = obj.x;
        cout << "Copy Constructor" << endl;
    }

    // Destructor
    ~B() {
        cout << "Destructor called" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    B b1;         // default
    B b2(10);     // parameterized
    B b3 = b2;    // copy

    return 0;
}
```

**Why use them?**

* **Constructor** initializes objects when created.
* **Destructor** cleans up resources when the object goes out of scope.
* **Copy constructor** used when copying objects (e.g., passing by value).

---

###  **Q3: Write output**

```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
int *p = arr;

cout << *p;        // Output: 10
cout << *p++;      // Output: 10 (p now points to arr[1])
cout << (*p)++;    // Output: 20 (then arr[1] becomes 21)
```

 **Final Output:**

```
1020
```

� `*p++` increments the pointer (not the value). `(*p)++` increments the value at that pointer.

---

### **Q4: Write output & explain**

```cpp
int x = 10, y = 20;
const int* p1 = &x; // Pointer to const int (data is const, pointer not)
int* const p2 = &x; // Constant pointer to int (pointer const, data not)

*p1 = 20;    // Error: can't modify value through pointer to const
p1 = &y;     // OK: pointer itself can point elsewhere

*p2 = 30;    // OK: data can be modified
p2 = &y;     // Error: can't change address held by const pointer
```

**Explanation:**

* `const int* p1` → **data is const**, pointer is not.
* `int* const p2` → **pointer is const**, data is not.

---

###  **Q5: Insert pairs in `map` and print using iterator**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    map<int, int> mp;

    // Insert values
    mp.insert({1, 1});
    mp.insert({2, 2});
    mp.insert({3, 3});
    mp.insert({4, 4});
    mp.insert({5, 5});

    // Print using iterator
    for (auto it = mp.begin(); it != mp.end(); ++it) {
        cout << it->first << " => " << it->second << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

 **Output:**

```
1 => 1
2 => 2
3 => 3
4 => 4
5 => 5
```

---

### **Q6: What is VPtr and VTable?**

**VTable (Virtual Table)** and **VPtr (Virtual Pointer)** are mechanisms used in **runtime polymorphism** (when using virtual functions).

* **VTable:**

  * A lookup table used to resolve function calls to virtual functions at runtime.
  * Each class with virtual functions has its own vtable.

* **VPtr:**

  * A hidden pointer in each object of a class having virtual functions.
  * Points to the class’s VTable.

Example:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() { cout << "Base" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override { cout << "Derived" << endl; }
};
```

* When you call `show()` via a `Base*` pointer pointing to a `Derived` object, VTable is used to dynamically resolve the correct function.

---

### **Q7: If we do not create a constructor, how is it handled in C++?**

###  **Compiler-Generated Default Constructor**

If you write:

```cpp
class A {
public:
    int x;
};
```

Then C++ automatically generates a constructor like this:

```cpp
A() { }  // Implicit default constructor
```

You can still create objects:

```cpp
A obj;    // Works fine — compiler provides a default constructor
```

---

### **Important Notes:**

####  **Case 1: No constructor defined**

* Compiler provides **default constructor**.
* Members like `int`, `float` are **not initialized** automatically (they hold garbage values unless initialized).

```cpp
class B {
public:
    int x;
};

int main() {
    B obj;
    cout << obj.x << endl;  // Garbage value
}
```

---

####  \*\*Case 2: You define **any** constructor, but **not the default one**

```cpp
class C {
public:
    C(int a) {}  // Parameterized constructor only
};

int main() {
    C obj;       //  Error: No default constructor
}
```

* If **you define a parameterized constructor**, the compiler **does NOT generate** a default one.
* You must manually define it if needed.

```cpp
class C {
public:
    C() {}         // Default constructor
    C(int a) {}    // Parameterized
};
```

## **1. What is a Race Condition? How to Prevent it?**

**Definition:**
A **race condition** occurs when multiple threads access and modify shared data **concurrently**, and the final result depends on the timing of their execution.

###  How to prevent it?

Use **mutual exclusion** mechanisms like:

* `std::mutex`
* `std::lock_guard`
* `std::atomic`

### **C++ Example (Using `std::mutex`):**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>
#include <mutex>

int counter = 0;
std::mutex mtx;

void increment() {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
        ++counter;
    }
}

int main() {
    std::thread t1(increment);
    std::thread t2(increment);
    t1.join();
    t2.join();
    std::cout << "Counter: " << counter << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

## **2. Explain the major differences between C++98, C++11, C++14, C++17, and C++20. Which features have you used most, which version have u used?**

### C++ Versions

* **C++98/03** → First standardized, OOP + STL.
* **C++11** → Smart pointers, auto, lambda, nullptr, move semantics.
* **C++14** → Small fixes, generic lambdas.
* **C++17** → `optional`, `variant`, structured binding.
* **C++20** → Concepts, ranges, coroutines.
* **C++23** → `std::expected`, better constexpr, ranges updates.

---

## **3. What is the difference between arrays and vectors in C++? When would you prefer one over the other?**

| Array                | Vector                       |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Fixed size           | Dynamic size                 |
| Stack/heap           | Heap                         |
| No inbuilt utilities | STL container with functions |
| Faster (no overhead) | Safer & flexible             |

---

## **4. What is Virtual Function, Explain how virtual functions work internally. Why use virtual functions?**

* Declared with `virtual` in base class.
* Enables **runtime polymorphism**.
* Uses **vtable + vptr** mechanism.

---

## **5. What is a pure virtual function? Why do we use them?**

---

## **6. Can we make an instance of abstract class?**

❌ No, because at least one pure virtual function is not implemented.

---

## **7. What is an abstract class in C++? Give an example.**

* A class having **at least one pure virtual function** = abstract class.
* Used as **base class** for polymorphism.

---

## **8. Pointer vs Object**

| Pointer                                   | Object                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Stores address of object                  | Actual object                   |
| Can point to derived class (polymorphism) | Cannot change type dynamically  |
| Needed for dynamic allocation             | Object created on stack or heap |

## **9. Why not use object instead of pointer?**

* Because objects use **compile-time binding**.
* For polymorphism (runtime binding), we need **base class pointer/reference**.

### **Akkodis Interview – Technical Round Interview**

## Q1. OOPs Concepts (C++)

**Core OOP concepts**:

| Concept           | Meaning                                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encapsulation** | Wrapping data and functions into a single unit (class).     |
| **Abstraction**   | Hiding implementation details, showing only interface.      |
| **Inheritance**   | Acquiring properties from a base class.                     |
| **Polymorphism**  | Same function behaves differently (overriding/overloading). |

---

##  Q2. Smart Pointer

Smart pointers in C++ manage memory automatically and help avoid leaks.

Example with `unique_ptr`:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(10));
    cout << *ptr << endl;  // prints 10
    return 0;
}
```

Types:

* `unique_ptr` – sole ownership
* `shared_ptr` – shared ownership
* `weak_ptr` – non-owning reference

---

##  Q3. Template

Templates allow **generic programming** (type-independent code):

```cpp
template <typename T>
T add(T a, T b) {
    return a + b;
}

int main() {
    cout << add<int>(5, 3) << endl;
    cout << add<float>(5.5, 3.3) << endl;
}
```

---

##  Q4. Function Overloading vs Overriding

### ▶ Function Overloading (same name, different params)

```cpp
class Demo {
public:
    void show(int x) { cout << "Int: " << x << endl; }
    void show(float y) { cout << "Float: " << y << endl; }
};
```

### ▶ Function Overriding (base vs derived class)

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() { cout << "Base" << endl; }
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void display() override { cout << "Derived" << endl; }
};
```

---

##  Q5. Lambda Function – Why Use?

Lambda = Anonymous function (quick, inline function)

### Example:

```cpp
auto add = [](int a, int b) { return a + b; };
cout << add(5, 3);  // Output: 8
```

 Use when:

* Short functions
* One-time callbacks (e.g., sort, filter)

---

## Q6. Lambda vs Normal Function

| Feature  | Lambda Function          | Normal Function       |
| -------- | ------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Name     | Anonymous                | Has a name            |
| Scope    | Defined inside functions | Global or class scope |
| Use case | Short, inline use        | Reusable logic        |
| Syntax   | `[](){}`                 | `return_type name()`  |

---

##  Q7. Fix and Explain This Code

### ❌ Original Code (Problematic):

```cpp
B obj;
obj & =A obj;  // ❌ Invalid syntax
obj->sum(15,10);  // ❌ obj is not a pointer
```

---

### Corrected Version:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class A {
public:
    virtual int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    void sum(float a, float b) {
        cout << "Float sum: " << a + b << endl;
    }
};

class B : public A {
public:
    int sum(int a, int b) override {
        int c = a + b;
        cout << "B::sum(int, int): " << c << endl;
        return c;
    }
};

int main() {
    // Make object dynamically
    B* obj = new B();

    // Make another reference as base class
    A* ref = obj;

    // Call overridden function
    ref->sum(15, 10);  // Will call B's version (runtime polymorphism)

    // Clean up
    delete obj;

    return 0;
}
```

---

##  Q8. Replace Second Occurrence With "l.k"

### Input: `apple`

### Output: `al.kle`

### Solution:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char input[100];
    cin >> input;

    char output[200];
    int count[256] = {0};
    int i = 0, j = 0;

    while (input[i] != '\0') {
        char ch = input[i];
        count[(int)ch]++;

        if (count[(int)ch] == 2) {
            output[j++] = 'l';
            output[j++] = '.';
            output[j++] = 'k';
        } else if (count[(int)ch] < 2) {
            output[j++] = ch;
        }
        i++;
    }

    output[j] = '\0';
    cout << "Modified: " << output << endl;

    return 0;
}
```

✅ Input: `apple` → `al.kle`
✅ Input: `balloon` → `bal.kon`

    // This will throw a compile-time error due to deleted copy constructor
    // Singleton s2 = *s1;  // ❌ Error
    // Singleton s3(*s1);   // ❌ Error

    return 0;
}

```

**Explanation:**
In the Singleton class, copy constructor and assignment operator are marked as `delete`. If you try to copy like `Singleton s2 = *s1;`, the compiler will throw an error. This enforces the Singleton pattern properly.

##  Q7. To access a variable (`g_i`) defined in `first.cpp` from `second.cpp`, you need to **declare it as `extern`** in `second.cpp`. This tells the compiler that the variable is defined in another translation unit (another `.cpp` file), and the linker will resolve it during linking.

---

## Step-by-Step Example

---

### `first.cpp` – Define the variable

```cpp
// first.cpp
#include <iostream>

int g_i = 42;  // Global variable definition

void printFirst() {
    std::cout << "Value of g_i in first.cpp: " << g_i << std::endl;
}
```

---

### `second.cpp` – Access the variable using `extern`

```cpp
// second.cpp
#include <iostream>

extern int g_i;  // Declaration of the variable defined in first.cpp

void printSecond() {
    std::cout << "Value of g_i in second.cpp: " << g_i << std::endl;

    g_i = 100;  // Modify the variable
    std::cout << "Modified g_i in second.cpp: " << g_i << std::endl;
}
```

---

### `main.cpp` – Call both functions

```cpp
// main.cpp
void printFirst();
void printSecond();

int main() {
    printFirst();
    printSecond();
    printFirst();  // Show modified value
    return 0;
}
```

---

### Compilation

You must compile all `.cpp` files together so the linker can resolve symbols:

```bash
g++ first.cpp second.cpp main.cpp -o program
./program
```

---

###  Output

```
Value of g_i in first.cpp: 42
Value of g_i in second.cpp: 42
Modified g_i in second.cpp: 100
Value of g_i in first.cpp: 100
```

### **Ceipal for Siemens interview – Technical Round Interview**
Round 1: 30 min

---

### Write all type constructor and given variable

---

### Problem Area:

```cpp
double &num2 = num;
```

This line:

* Tries to **initialize a reference** member (`num2`) directly at the point of declaration.
* This **is not allowed** in C++ because reference members must be initialized in the **constructor initializer list**, not inside the class body.

---

### 🛠️ Solution:

To fix this, you must **use an initializer list** in **all constructors** that involve `num2`. That means:

1. Remove this line from the class body:

```cpp
double &num2 = num;   //  Remove this
```

2. Update **each constructor** to initialize `num2` properly using an initializer list.

---

###  Fixed Code:

Here's your **corrected version** of the code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Base {
public:
    const char* ptr;   // pointer to const char*
    double num;         // a number
    string str;         // a string
    double &num2;       // reference to a double

    // 1. Default Constructor
    Base() : ptr("Default"), num(0.0), str("None"), num2(num) {
        cout << "Default Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

    // 2. Parameterized Constructor
    Base(const char* _ptr, double num1, string str1, double& num3)
        : ptr(_ptr), num(num1), str(str1), num2(num3) {
        cout << "Parameterized Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

    // 3. Copy Constructor
    Base(const Base& other)
        : ptr(other.ptr), num(other.num), str(other.str), num2(other.num2) {
        cout << "Copy Constructor Called" << endl;
    }

    // 4. Destructor
    ~Base() {
        cout << "Destructor Called" << endl;
    }

    // Function to display object data
    void display() {
        cout << "ptr: " << ptr << endl;
        cout << "num: " << num << endl;
        cout << "str: " << str << endl;
        cout << "num2 points to value: " << num2 << endl;
    }
};

// ---------------- MAIN FUNCTION ----------------
int main() {
    double n = 50.5;

    // Default constructor
    Base b1;
    b1.display();

    cout << "-----------------------------" << endl;

    // Parameterized constructor
    Base b2("Hello", 10.5, "Brijesh", n);
    b2.display();

    cout << "-----------------------------" << endl;

    // Copy constructor
    Base b3 = b2;
    b3.display();

    return 0;
}
```

---

### Notes:

* **Reference members** (`double &num2`) **must be initialized** in the constructor’s initializer list — they cannot be assigned later.
* Same applies to **`const` data members**.
* If you ever need to copy reference semantics, remember: the reference will refer to the same original object, not a new one.

---

### Output (expected):

### **Areteminds interview – Technical Round Interview MFC**
Round 1: 30 min

### **1 Explain how message maps work in MFC**

**Answer:**
In **MFC (Microsoft Foundation Class)**, **message maps** are used to connect Windows messages (like button clicks, mouse moves, etc.) to specific **member functions** in a class.

* Instead of writing a long `switch` statement (like in Win32 API), MFC uses **macros** to map messages to handlers.
* The `BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP` and `END_MESSAGE_MAP` macros define the mapping.
* When a message is received, MFC checks the map and calls the corresponding handler.

**Example:**

```cpp
BEGIN_MESSAGE_MAP(CMyWnd, CFrameWnd)
    ON_WM_PAINT()       // Maps WM_PAINT to OnPaint()
    ON_WM_DESTROY()     // Maps WM_DESTROY to OnDestroy()
END_MESSAGE_MAP()
```

Here:

* `WM_PAINT` → calls `CMyWnd::OnPaint()`
* `WM_DESTROY` → calls `CMyWnd::OnDestroy()`

**In short:**
Message maps in MFC replace manual message handling (using `GetMessage`/`DispatchMessage`) with an **automatic mapping system** that makes code cleaner and easier to maintain.

---

### **2 What is the purpose of the message loop in a Win32 or MFC application?**

**Explain how `GetMessage()`, `TranslateMessage()`, and `DispatchMessage()` work together.**

**Answer:**
The **message loop** (also called **event loop**) is the heart of any Windows or MFC application.
It continuously retrieves messages from the **message queue**, processes them, and sends them to the appropriate **window procedure**.

**Purpose:**
It keeps the application **responsive** to user input (mouse, keyboard, system events).

**Typical loop:**

```cpp
MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
    TranslateMessage(&msg);
    DispatchMessage(&msg);
}
```

**Explanation of functions:**

* � **GetMessage()**

  * Retrieves the next message from the queue.
  * Returns `FALSE` when `WM_QUIT` is received (causes loop to end).

*  **TranslateMessage()**

  * Converts virtual-key messages (like keyboard input) into character messages (WM_CHAR).
  * It helps text input work properly.

*  **DispatchMessage()**

  * Sends the message to the **Window Procedure (WndProc)** for handling (e.g., WM_PAINT, WM_DESTROY).

*****
```

### **Solution (C++)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

        // print spaces

            cout << "*";
        }

        cout << endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

---

### **Q2. What are OOPs Concepts?**

**Answer:**
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is a programming paradigm based on **objects** and **classes**.
The four main concepts are:

1. **Encapsulation** – Binding data and functions together, and restricting direct access to data.
2. **Abstraction** – Showing only necessary details and hiding internal implementation.
3. **Inheritance** – Acquiring properties and behaviors of one class into another.
4. **Polymorphism** – One interface, many implementations (function overloading & overriding).

---

### **Q3. What is a Constructor?**

**Answer:**
A **constructor** is a special member function of a class that is automatically executed when an object is created.

* It has the **same name** as the class.
* It **does not have a return type** (not even void).

**Example:**

```cpp
class A {
public:
    A() {   // Constructor
        cout << "Constructor Called";
    }
};
```

---

### **Q4. Check if a string is Palindrome (C++ Without STL Functions)**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    char str[100];
    cin >> str;

    int i = 0;
    int j = 0;

    // Find length
    while(str[j] != '\0') {
        j++;
    }
    j--; // move j to last index

    int flag = 1;

    while(i < j) {
        if(str[i] != str[j]) {
            flag = 0;
            break;
        }
        i++;
        j--;
    }

    if(flag == 1)
        cout << "Palindrome";
    else
        cout << "Not Palindrome";

    return 0;
}
```

Q. Role and resposbilities in this project
Q. daily basis work
---

### **Q1. What are OOP Concepts in C++?**

**Answer:**
OOP organizes code into **classes and objects**.
Main concepts:

1. **Encapsulation:** Binding data and methods (using private/public).
2. **Abstraction:** Hiding internal implementation.
3. **Inheritance:** Reusing features of one class into another.
4. **Polymorphism:** Same function behaving differently (overloading & overriding).

---

### **Q2. Why do we have a virtual destructor but not a virtual constructor?**

**Answer:**

* **Virtual Destructor:** Ensures **derived destructor runs** when deleting via base pointer.
* **Constructor cannot be virtual** because **object type must be known before creation**, and virtual dispatch works **after creation**.

---

### **Q3. Why is a virtual destructor required?**

**Answer:**
To **avoid memory leaks**; ensures **derived class destructor** executes first when deleting through a **base class pointer**.

---

### **Q4. Why can't we overload a destructor in C++?**

**Answer:**
A class has **only one destructor** `~ClassName()` and it **cannot take parameters**, so **overloading is not possible**.

---

### **Q5. Why does destructor have no parameters?**

**Answer:**
Destructor is called **automatically** by compiler.
Allowing parameters would **break automatic cleanup**.

---

### **Q6. When is the copy constructor called?**

**Answer:**
Copy constructor is called when:

1. `A obj2 = obj1;` (initialization)
2. Passing object **by value**
3. Returning object **by value**
4. Explicit copy `A obj2(obj1);`

---

### **Q7. What happens if we don’t use `&` in copy constructor?**

**Answer:**
It leads to **infinite recursion** because passing by value requires another copy → compiler error or program crash.

---

### **Q8. What is Shallow Copy and Deep Copy?**

| Type             | Definition                                                     |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shallow Copy** | Copies pointer value only → both objects share **same memory** |
| **Deep Copy**    | Copies **actual data** → objects have **separate memory**      |

---

### **Q9. When do we need Shallow or Deep Copy?**

* Use **Shallow Copy** when **no dynamic memory** is used.
* Use **Deep Copy** when **class contains pointers / heap memory**.

---

### **Q10. What is Upcasting?**

**Answer:**
Converting **Derived class object** to **Base class pointer/reference**.
Safe and automatic.

```cpp
Base *ptr = new Derived();
```

---

### **Q11. What is Downcasting?**

**Answer:**
Converting **Base pointer** back to **Derived pointer**.
Done manually using `dynamic_cast`.

```cpp
Derived *d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(ptr);
```

---

### **Q12. What is Virtual Inheritance?**

**Answer:**
Used to **avoid diamond problem** by ensuring **only one copy** of the base class exists.

```cpp
class B : virtual public A {};
class C : virtual public A {};
```

---

### **Q13. What is Virtual Function, vtable, and vptr?**

| Term                 | Definition                                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Virtual Function** | Allows **runtime polymorphism** (function resolved at runtime). |
| **vtable**           | Table storing addresses of virtual functions.                   |
| **vptr**             | Pointer inside each object pointing to its **vtable**.          |

---

### **Q14. Replace zeros and sort the final array**

**Array 1:** `1 2 3 0 0 0`
**Array 2:** `2 5 6`

**Step 1:** Replace zeros → `1 2 3 2 5 6`
**Step 2:** Sort → `1 2 2 3 5 6`

**Final Output:**

```
1 2 2 3 5 6
```

**Program:**

```cpp
int arr1[6] = {1,2,3,0,0,0};
int arr2[3] = {2,5,6};
int j = 0;

for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    if(arr1[i] == 0) {
        arr1[i] = arr2[j++];
    }
}

for(int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
    for(int k = i+1; k < 6; k++) {
        if(arr1[i] > arr1[k]) {
            int t = arr1[i];
            arr1[i] = arr1[k];
            arr1[k] = t;
        }
    }
}
```

---

# ✅ **Q1. Write shared pointer class implementation (without using any library). Also explain: what is a shared pointer?**

### **Answer:**

A **shared pointer** is a smart pointer that maintains **reference counting**.
Multiple shared pointers can point to the same object, and the object is destroyed **only when the last shared pointer goes out of scope**.

### **Simple Implementation:**

```cpp
template <typename T>
class SharedPtr {
private:
    T* ptr;
    int* refCount;

public:
    SharedPtr(T* p = nullptr) : ptr(p), refCount(new int(1)) {}

    SharedPtr(const SharedPtr& other) {
        ptr = other.ptr;
        refCount = other.refCount;
        ++(*refCount);
    }

    SharedPtr& operator=(const SharedPtr& other) {
        if (this != &other) {
            if (--(*refCount) == 0) {
                delete ptr;
                delete refCount;
            }
            ptr = other.ptr;
            refCount = other.refCount;
            ++(*refCount);
        }
        return *this;
    }

    ~SharedPtr() {
        if (--(*refCount) == 0) {
            delete ptr;
            delete refCount;
        }
    }

    T* operator->() { return ptr; }
    T& operator*() { return *ptr; }
};
```

---

# ✅ **Q2. What is `dynamic_cast`?**

### **Answer:**

`dynamic_cast` is used for **safe downcasting** in polymorphic class hierarchies.
It uses **runtime type information (RTTI)** to check whether the cast is valid.

If invalid:

* For pointers → returns `nullptr`
* For references → throws `bad_cast` exception

---

# ✅ **Q3. What is the relevance of `mutable` keyword?**

### **Answer:**

`mutable` allows a class data member to be **modified even inside a const member function**.

Example:

```cpp
class Test {
    mutable int counter;
public:
    void func() const {
        counter++;  // allowed
    }
};
```

---

# ✅ **Q4. What is the purpose of `volatile` keyword?**

### **Answer:**

`volatile` tells the compiler **not to optimize** the variable because its value may change unexpectedly (hardware registers, multi-threaded flags).

Example:

```cpp
volatile int flag;
```

---

# ✅ **Q5. Write a class with static int x, char* y, string, const int p, int& q. Write a parameterized constructor.**

### **Answer (your solution is correct):**

```cpp
class A {
public:
    static int x;
    char* y;
    string s;
    const int p;
    int& q;

    A(char* yVal, const string& str, int pVal, int& qRef)
        : y(yVal), s(str), p(pVal), q(qRef)
    {
        A::x++;
    }
};

int A::x = 0;
```

---

# ✅ **Q6. Why is `int A::x = 0;` initialized with zero?

Also write display(), add() and explain p++, q++, x++ cases.
If we remove p++, will it work?**

### **Answer:**

### ✔ Why initialized with zero?

Static variables **must be defined outside** the class.
If you don't assign a value, it will still default to 0, but explicit initialization is good practice.

---

### ✔ display() method:

```cpp
static void display() {
    cout << "x = " << x << endl;
}
```

---

### ✔ add() method (const):

```cpp
void add() const {
    x++;   // allowed → static variable
    q++;   // allowed → q refers to external int
    // p++;  // NOT allowed → p is const
}
```

---

### ✔ If we remove `p++`, will code work?

**Yes**, after removing `p++`, the `add()` method will compile successfully.

---

# ✅ **Q7. What is the difference between composition and inheritance?**

### **Answer:**

| **Composition**                  | **Inheritance**                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| "Has-a" relationship             | "Is-a" relationship                |
| Object is part of another object | Class derives behavior from parent |
| More flexible                    | Less flexible                      |
| Preferred in modern design       | Can cause tight coupling           |

Example:
Car *has a* Engine → **composition**
Car *is a* Vehicle → **inheritance**

---

# ✅ **Q8. Implement `strcpy` without using inbuilt functions.**

### **Answer:**

```cpp
char* myStrcpy(char* dest, const char* src) {
    char* temp = dest;
    while (*src != '\0') {
        *dest = *src;
        dest++;
        src++;
    }
    *dest = '\0';
    return temp;
}
```

---

# ✅ **Q9. What is function overriding? When is it used?**

### **Answer:**

Function overriding occurs when a **derived class provides a new implementation** of a **virtual function** in the base class.

Used for runtime polymorphism:

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void show() {}
};

class Derived : public Base {
public:
    void show() override {}
};
```

---

# ✅ **Q10. What is runtime polymorphism?**

### **Answer:**

Runtime polymorphism occurs when the function call is resolved **at runtime**, not compile-time.
Achieved using **virtual functions + base class pointer/reference**.

---

# ✅ **Q11. What is virtual table (vtable) and vptr? When is vptr created?**

### **Answer:**

* **vtable** → Table storing addresses of virtual functions.
* **vptr** → Hidden pointer inside each object that points to its class’s vtable.
* **vptr is created by compiler**:
  ✔ When an object of the class is created
  ✔ Before the constructor starts executing

---

# ✅ **Q12. Which debugging tools are commonly used?**

### **Answer:**

* GDB
* Valgrind
* Visual Studio Debugger
* LLDB
* Perf
* strace / ltrace

---

# ✅ **Q13. What tools detect memory leaks?**

### **Answer:**

* Valgrind (Memcheck)
* AddressSanitizer (ASan)
* LeakSanitizer (LSan)
* Dr.Memory
* Visual Studio Memory Diagnostics

---

# ✅ **Q14. How to run GDB?**

### **Answer:**

1. Compile with debug symbols:

   ```bash
   g++ -g main.cpp -o app
   ```
2. Run with GDB:

   ```bash
   gdb ./app
   ```
3. Useful commands:

   ```
   run
   break main
   next
   step
   print variable
   continue
   quit
   ```

    void showDetails() {
        cout << "Name: " << name << ", Age: " << age << endl;
    }
    ~Person() {}
};

// Single Inheritance
class Student : public Person {
protected:
    int roll;

public:
    Student(string n, int a, int r) : Person(n, a), roll(r) {}

```c
#include <stdio.h>

// Function that takes 2 int and returns float
float A(int a, int b) {
    float c = a + b;
    return c;
}

int main() {
    // Function pointer
    float (*ptr)(int, int) = A;

    float result = ptr(5, 6);
    printf("%f\n", result);

    return 0;
}
```
